## The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)
One of the top highlights of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is its famous and extensive collection of **European paintings**.

This is where we headed first.

You can ooh and aah over a mind-boggling number of gorgeous European artworks (more than 2,500, in fact) from the **13th to the 19th centuries**.

Works by the Spanish artists El Greco and Goya. Dutch art from the 17th century by Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer. French paintings by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne and Van Gogh.
